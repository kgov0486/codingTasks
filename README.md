The coding task name is Exploratorary Data Analysis

The task involved working with public available dataset titanic.csv and perform data analysis. In particular I am assessing what are the important factor in determing survival of the Titanic incident. It is important to learning this coding as we (data scientists) need to understand how to clean data, preprocess and use appropriate data visualisations to make summaries,

In order to run the code one must have downloaded the titanic.csv file and make sure it is in the same directory as the code file

Usage: 

This code produces graphs such as this example
